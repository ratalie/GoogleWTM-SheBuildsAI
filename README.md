Google's Women Techmakers presents She Builds AI
# Project Description:
This project aims to inspire and empower young girls by creating personalized motivational videos that are tailored to their dreams and aspirations. Girls from around the world submit their career goals, backgrounds, and personal stories through a multi-modal platform. The platform uses AI to process these submissions (text, video, handwritten), matches them with a role model from a diverse pre-existing database, and generates a personalized, one-minute inspirational video.

The project addresses gender inequality by:

Providing girls in remote or underserved communities access to powerful role models, regardless of geographic barriers.
Encouraging girls to pursue leadership roles and ambitious career paths, inspired by women who have achieved success in those fields.
Offering practical advice and follow-up resources in the videos, helping girls understand the steps they need to take to realize their dreams.
Through this platform, we hope to promote gender equality by giving young girls the motivation and confidence to pursue leadership roles in their chosen fields.
